# Columns Plus block

This block shows the provided content in a Columns display.

Create a table in the Word document, with at least 2 rows.

Any row with a single column containing an image and no text will be used as a background image for the following rows.
Text brightness is based on the background brightness, so that the text is always legible.

Rows with multiple columns or rows containing text will be rendered as part of the Columns display.

Insert a link to an mp4 video to create an auto playing video element in the Columns display.
